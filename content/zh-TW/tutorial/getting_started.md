[開發產品原型]

The developer develop a prototype by first create a prototype in the Development console. A prototype may have several data channels which take different datapoint types.

[Create Test Device]

AFter creating a prototype, the developer can create a test device to test and control his device. The developer can also use the my device console to visually view the simulated result for his prototype or to control the devices.

[Managing deployed test devices]

The developer can monitor all the test devices under each prototype in the Development console, the developer can also view all the test device in the My device console which he has the access for.

In the future, when the prototype is release to the end user, the end user can manage and configure the device in the My device console as well to view the data, set notification, and share the device to other users.

[Manage your profile]
