**Please note:**

Do not use login using labs@mediatek.com option. This feature is still under developement. When you first sign-on with MCS using Labs@mediatek when accessing MCS website, in the background we have created your new account in MCS using the email address as your account ID. Therefore, the current fix is, you can go back to web site and  click "forgot password" and enter your email address, a forgot password reset email will send to your mailbox. You can then set a new password and come back and login by using your email and the new password. You can then be able to login to the Moble App in the same fashion.


Once logged in, you will be able to see devices that are created and belongs to you
